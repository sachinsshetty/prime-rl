## Overview

PRIME-RL is a framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning. It is designed to be easy-to-use and hackable, yet capable of scaling to 1000+ GPUs. Beyond that, here is why we think you might like it:

1. Integrates natively with [`verifiers`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers) environments via the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars)
2. Supports end-to-end post-training, including SFT and RL training and evals
3. Rayless multi-node deployment with [FSDP2](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) training and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) inference backend
4. Designed for asynchronous training in decentralized settings
5. Hackable, modular and extensible by nature

## Setup

> *We develop and test on NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090/5090, A100, H100, H200, and B200. If your setup fails, please create an [issue](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/issues).*

### Prerequisites

Currently, you **need at least one NVIDIA GPU to use PRIME-RL**. If you don't already have access to one, we recommend our [compute platform](https://app.primeintellect.ai) for everything from renting on-demand single GPUs for developing, debugging and small ablations, to [reserving 1000+ GPU clusters](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/quotes) for production-scale training.

### Quick Setup

Set up PRIME-RL in a single command.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
<summary>
Manual Setup
</summary>
<br>

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl.git
cd prime-rl
```

2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

3. Install dependencies from the lock file

```bash
uv sync && uv sync --all-extras
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Validate your environment setup
</summary>
<br>

1. Check that the environment uses Python 3.12

```bash
uv run python -V
```

2. Check that `flash-attn` is installed

```bash
uv run python -c "import flash_attn"
```

3. Check that you can run SFT trainer  (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run sft @ configs/debug/sft/train.toml
```

4. Check that you can run the RL trainer (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run trainer @ configs/debug/rl/train.toml
```

5. Check that you can run the inference server (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run inference @ configs/debug/infer.toml
```

*Keep the inference server running in the background for the next steps.*

5.1. Check that you can run the orchestrator against the inference server

```bash
uv run orchestrator @ configs/debug/orch.toml
```

5.2. Check that you can run evals against the inference server

```bash
uv run eval @ configs/debug/eval.toml
```

</details>

### Additional Setup

1. If you want to log your runs to [W&B](https://wandb.ai), log in

```bash
uv run wandb login
# Or set `export WANDB_API_KEY=...`
```

2. If you require gated/ private models or datasets from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), log in

```bash
uv run huggingface-cli login
# Or set `export HF_TOKEN=...`
```

## Training Examples

We provide end-to-end training examples in the [`examples`](examples) directory to highlight features of the framework and guide you through the process of training your own models.

1. [**Reverse Text**](examples/reverse_text/README.md): Train `Qwen3-0.6B` / `SmolLM-135M` to reverse a small chunk of text. Demonstrates tiny-scale single-turn SFT and RL training. Can be trained on a single consumer GPU in a few minutes, and is ideal for getting started. ``
2. [**Wordle**](examples/wordle/README.md): Train `Qwen3-1.7B` to play Wordle. A fun example of multi-turn SFT and RL training. Can be trained on a 2-4 H100 GPUs in a few hours. Ideal for exploring the multi-turn training capabilities of the framework.
3. *More to come...*

## Contributing

We warmly welcome community contributions! We use [issues](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/issues) to track bugs, feature requests, and share our internal roadmap. If you encounter bugs, have pain points during development, or have ideas for new features, please open an issue.

Contributions are welcome via PR. Please follow these guidelines:
1. Install the [pre-commit hooks](#pre-commit-hooks) to ensure your code is formatted correctly.
2. Please keep your PR in "Draft" until it is ready for review.
3. If your PR resolves an issue, please link the issue in the PR description
4. If you can, try running the [test suite](#tests) locally to ensure your changes are working as expected.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Please install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure your code is formatted correctly.

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Tests

Run the full test suite 

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

To run unit tests, run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -v
```

To run integration tests, run

```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration -v
```

To run CPU-only tests, use the inverse of the `gpu` marker:

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m "not gpu"
```
